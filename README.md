# Unhandled Division by Zero in PHP Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: unhandled division by zero. The `foo` function does not check for division by zero before performing the operation. This leads to an error if either of the inputs is 0.
The solution demonstrates how to handle this situation by adding a check for zero values and returning an appropriate error message or value.
